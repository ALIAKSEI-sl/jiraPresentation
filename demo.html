          <p style="font-size: 36px">
            Jira Software launched in 2002 as an issue tracking and project
            management tool for teams. Since then, 65,000 companies globally
            have adopted Jira for its flexibility to support any type of project
            and extensibility to work with thousands of apps and integrations.

            <h3>Boards</h3>
            <p>
              An agile board is a tool that helps teams plan, visualize, and
              manage that work. In Jira Software, the board displays a selection
              of issues in columns, with each column representing a step in your
              team’s workflow for taking work through completion. A board
              accompanies each Jira Software project by default and provides the
              team with a shared view of all work that hasn't started, work that
              is in progress, and work that is completed.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <p>
              Your board can be found in the sidebar navigation under “Board”.

              A Jira project houses the collection of all issues that need to be
              completed to achieve a particular goal. A Jira board, on the other
              hand, is the tool used to manage those issues as they move from
              creation to completion. Boards are flexible tools that can be used
              variety of ways depending on the team’s unique way of working. For
              example:
            </p>
            <p style="font-size: 30px">
              Teams that practice scrum use the board to display a prioritized
              selection of issues that the team has committed to complete within
              a sprint, or time-boxed period. Issues outside of this selection
              can be found in the backlog.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size: 30px">
              Teams that practice kanban use the board as their work management
              tool for all issues, moving each issue through the columns from
              creation to completion.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size: 30px">
              Teams with larger projects or multiple workstreams use multiple or
              cross-project boards to more easily track and manage different
              types of work.

            <h3>Timeline</h3>
            <p>
              The timeline is a planning view available in all Jira Software
              plans that allows you to plan work, track progress, and map
              dependencies within a single team and project. Both team-managed
              and company-managed projects are supported in the timeline view.

            <h4>What are epics?</h4>
            <p style="font-size: 30px">
              In Jira Software, epics represent large bodies of work that can be
              broken down into individual tasks. This work becomes a child issue
              of the epic, which is sometimes referred to as the parent issue.
              Issues are displayed as colored bars on the timeline.
            </p>
            <img
              src="https://wac-cdn.atlassian.com/dam/jcr:dc8861f6-4395-4f35-89a3-34d6a51e4051/Overview%20-%20what%20are%20epics.png?cdnVersion=1127"

          <section>
            <h4>What are child issues?</h4>
            <p style="font-size: 30px">
              Child issues can be created directly in the timeline view and are
              nested within the epic they belong to. The most common child
              issues are stories, tasks, and bugs, but you can create new issue
              types to represent different pieces of work for your teams.
            </p>
            <img
              src="https://wac-cdn.atlassian.com/dam/jcr:25f3b2c6-5cf0-48c7-bb41-50828a82a0cf/Overview%20-%20what%20are%20child%20issues.png?cdnVersion=1127"

          <section>
            <h4>What are dependencies?</h4>
            <p style="font-size: 28px">
              Dependency management is critical for teams. When dependencies are
              visualized and well-mapped, a team can adapt and plan for
              alternative paths. In Jira Software, you can easily show the
              relationship between epics and child issues by mapping
              dependencies directly from the on the timeline. Dependencies, also
              called issue links, allow you to show the order in which issues
              need to be done. For example, a dependency between two issues may
              indicate that there’s a potential blocker that the team needs to
              address. In order to use this feature, a Jira admin needs to
              enable issue linking.

            <h3>Insights</h3>
            <p>
              In Jira Software, insights help the team make data-driven
              decisions without leaving their current context. Insights source
              data from your Jira boards and projects to present aggregated
              views of your team’s historical progress. Insights are currently
              available for scrum metrics in both company-managed and
              team-managed projects.

            <h3>What are backlog insights?</h3>
            <p>
              These insights provide support for you and your team to make data
              driven decisions during sprint planning sessions and
              retrospectives all within the context of your backlog view.

              In Jira Software, an app (sometimes called an add-on or plugin) is
              an installable component that supplements or enhances the
              functionality of your instance. You and your teams can spend less
              time managing work and more time building great software with over
              3,000 Jira Software apps that can be custom-tailored to fit any
              and every use case.

            <p>
              Jira is incredibly flexible and can be customized to work with
              your team’s unique workflow, meaning teams of all kinds can enjoy
              increased productivity and visibility as they march toward
              releasing amazing software.

            <h3>Step 1 - Create a project</h3>
            <p>
              Log into your Jira Software site. In the top navigation, select
              the “Projects” dropdown and select “Create project”.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h3>Step 2 - Pick a template</h3>
            <p style="font-size: 36px">
              There are dozens of templates across the Jira Family, each of
              which is designed to get your team started quickly and
              successfully. Today, Jira Software offers three templates:
            </p>
            <p style="font-size: 36px">
              В шаблонах Scrum и Kanban вам также будет предложено выбрать тип
              проекта. Принципиальное различие между этими двумя типами проектов
              заключается в способе их администрирования и уровне управления (на
              уровне команды либо компании/администратора Jira).

                managing in-progress work. (Includes the option of a kanban

            <h3>Step 3 - Set up your columns</h3>
            <p>
              In Jira Software, the board displays a selection of issues in
              columns, with each column representing a step in your team’s
              workflow for taking work through completion. Although there are
              many things you can configure on your board, we suggest just
              setting up columns for now. When you're getting started on a new
              Jira Software project, it's important to make your board reflect
              the way your team works.

            <h3>Step 4 - Create an issue</h3>
            <p>
              Issues are the building blocks of your Jira Software project. An
              issue can represent a story, epic, bug, feature to be built, or
              any other task in your project. Select “Create” in the top
              navigation. Your issue will appear in the backlog or board of the
              project.

            <h3>Step 6 - Invite your team</h3>
            <p>
              It’s time to get the party started! Once you have enough work
              represented on your board, start inviting team members.

            <h3>Step 7 - Move work forward</h3>
            <p style="font-size: 30px">
              Now that your team has joined your Jira Software site, you're
              ready to collaborate and track work together. If you're in a scrum
              project, you'll need to create and start a sprint to begin
              tracking work. If you're in a kanban project, you can start
              tracking work on the board. To track work items, move an issue
              from one column to another as it progresses through your team's
              workflow.
